# Todo-App

This project is a simple To-Do List application that allows users to add, prioritize, delete, and archive tasks. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stores data locally in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add tasks with a name and priority.
- **Priority Selection:** Tasks can be assigned a priority (low, medium, high) and are color-coded accordingly.

- **Archive Management:** Users can view, restore, or permanently delete archived tasks.
- **Local Storage:** All tasks and their states are stored in local storage to persist across sessions.

### Future-Work:

- **Task Management:** Tasks can be marked as complete, pending, or deleted.
