# Closure:

- Closures in JavaScript are a powerful and fundamental concept that involves a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state or lexical environment.
- They allow a function to retain access to variables from its outer function even after the outer function has executed.

Note: _A closure is formed when a function is defined within another function, allowing the inner function to access the outer function's variables and scope._

```
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;  // a variable in the outer scope

    function increment() {  // a nested function
        count++;  // accessing outer scope variable
        console.log(count);
    }

    return increment;  // returning the nested function
}

let counter = createCounter();  // store the returned function in a variable
counter();  // Output: 1
counter();  // Output: 2
```

## Debouncing:

- Debouncing is a crucial concept in web development that addresses challenges related to handling continuous user input, such as search bars or text inputs.
- It helps control the rate at which a function is invoked, preventing excessive calls and optimizing performance.

```
function deBounce(fun, delay) {
  let timer;

  return function () {
    if (timer) {
      clearTimeout(timer);
    }

    timer = setTimeout(function () {
      // fetchData()
      fun();
    }, delay);
  };
}

let deBounce1 = deBounce(fetchData, 1000);
```

## Throttling:

- Throttling is a crucial concept in web development that helps control the rate at which a function is invoked, ensuring it does not execute more often than a specified time interval.
- This optimization technique is particularly useful in scenarios like scroll events or continuous user-triggered actions.

```
function throttling(fun,delay){
    let flag = false;//timer is not running

    return function (){
        if(flag==true){
            //if timer is running i will simply return or do nothing
            return;
        }
        fun()

        flag =true;//timer is starting
        setTimeout(function(){
            flag =false;
            //timer is end
        },delay)

    }
}

let throttling1 = throttling(fetchData,1000);
```
